                    <p className="hero--section-description"> My name is Nate Love. I am from San Antonio and attended UT Austin for an undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering 
                        and am currently pursuing my Master's of Computer Science with a focus in AI/ML, expected graduation May 2026. </p>
                    <p className="hero--section-description"> I am a transitioning Army officer with 3+ years of experience as a Data Analyst, leading strategic and operational planning for a Battalion of 500+ soldiers 
                        and managing $100M+ in equipment. I developed predictive models, led analytics teams, and built automated reporting systems that enhanced data-driven decision-making across complex military operations.
                    </p>
                    <p className="hero--section-description"> My professional experience spans data analysis, risk assessment, logistics forecasting, and database management with CRUD operations. 
                        I've built Excel-based predictive models, coordinated development of warfighting systems using Agile methodologies, and consistently delivered mission-critical insights to command leadership. 
                    </p>
                    <p className="hero--section-description"> I bring a mission-driven mindset, proven leadership skills, and sharp learning ability to tackle complex technical challenges. 
                        In my free time, I love to run, play chess, and hike or climb outdoors as much as possible. I love watching sports and am always keeping up with my Longhorns and Packers. </p>
