                    <p className="hero--section-description"> My name is Nate Love. I am from San Antonio and attended UT Austin for an undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering 
                        and am currently attending UT Austin for their Master's of Computer Science. </p>
                    <p className="hero--section-description"> I spent 3 fast-paced and excellent years in the Army as an Armor Officer. I served in various leadership roles at Fort Benning, GA and at Fort Cavazos, TX before
                        deciding to seperate and move to Fort Worth, TX with my wonderful fiance. The Army presented me with a myriad of leadership experiences that ranged from planning large military exercises,
                        fundraising, budget and procurement requests, and supply-chain operations. 
                    </p>
                    <p className="hero--section-description"> I kept up my engineering skills with personal projects and by utilising the Army's free access to courses to continue to learn in my time off. </p>
                    <p className="hero--section-description"> In my free time, I love to run, play chess, and hike or climb outdoors as much as possible. I love watching sports and am always keeping up with my Longhorns and Packers. </p>
